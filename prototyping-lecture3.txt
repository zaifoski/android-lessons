LEZIONE 3: PROTOTYPE
Ghosh
-----------------------
-----------------------

design -> develop -> deliver

UI: Aspetto + UX: come ci si interagisce

based on target device you must change interaction style

ES: alarm -> simple

fail cheap, quick, often => prototype before you build

prototype = testable early version of app. at first, as simple as possible

sw architecture: take requirements, blueprint, model, prototype, ...
                 a lot of feedback & iteraction of above
                 build
                 es. sagrada familia
                 
sw prototype -> paper, give it to users

WHY PROTOTYPE:
- how users will react
- how they will interact with app,
- validate assumptions
- to compare alternatives

Know who your users are and how they plan to use your application
=> talk to the users through prototypes.

Scrumptious.

prototype -> feedback -> validate or modify

TECHNIQUES:
- paper
    have representative users interact with the paper version
    =) very easy to get negative feedback
    =) requires minimum version
    =( not so intuitive for users
- wireframes and page schematics. HTML wireframes
    =) lo posso displayare sull'effettivo dispositivo
    =) però è più realistico per user
    =) clicchi e funziona
    =( swipe, drag and drop ecc non funziona
    =( more effort than paper
- interactive prototypes

TOOLS

"pencil project" -> free

"proto", "marvel" -> browser
 
"pixate" -> now part of google, similar to marvel
 
"Justinmind" -> 30 days trial version oppure free version
             -> drag drop staff
             -> At a certain point: adobe/photoshop/skatch: I can import

"Marvel"

"pop" / "invisionapp" -> simplicity of paper prototyping and make it interactive

COMPITI:
-----------------------

Shopping cart application.
e.g.: can tell you which shop you go to that is less expensive
e.g.: social, se hai coinquilini ti dice le cose che tutti hanno messo
e.g.: smart fridge

1° passo: cercare le existing shopping carts applications e vedere cosa offrono
